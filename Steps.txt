Create a git hub repo.
create virtual env.
create a file setup and inside this we write our packages and install this.
move the .git file from respected dir to main dir so everything is push to the
github.
use -e . is use in requiements.txt so no need to run the setup it automatically pick it.
Than use multiple git cmds.
